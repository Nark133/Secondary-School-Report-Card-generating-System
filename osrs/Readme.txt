Project: Secondary School Report Card Generating system using PHP/MySQLi

About
The Secondary School Report Card Generating system is a simple PHP/MySQLi project that provides an online result of the students' marks. The system has a user-friendly user interface which makes it easy to use. This system has 2 types of users which are the Administrator User and The Student User. The Administrator user is the user who is in charge of managing the data in the system such as the subject list and the student list. Only admin users can manage the student result and marks and the Student Users can only view their results and they can only access their results by providing or submitting their Student ID number as their system credentials. The student result displays the student marks per subject and the average from the sum of their marks.
